📌 FIFA Players Statistics – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Wrangling

A comprehensive data analysis project focused on cleaning, transforming, and exploring FIFA player statistics using Python. This repository includes full data-wrangling steps, exploratory visualizations, feature insights, and structured workflows for understanding player attributes, performance metrics, and overall dataset patterns.

🚀 Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data wrangling on a FIFA player dataset.
The aim is to:

Clean and preprocess raw data

Handle missing or inconsistent values

Engineer new useful features

Visualize player distributions

Explore correlations between attributes

Produce insights for scouting, player comparison, and performance understanding

🧹 Data Wrangling Steps

✔️ Detecting and handling missing values
✔️ Removing duplicates
✔️ Converting data types (e.g., wages, value, heights, weights)
✔️ Encoding categorical attributes
✔️ Normalizing and scaling numerical features
✔️ Feature extraction and feature engineering
✔️ Creating clean, structured datasets ready for ML or dashboards

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project provides deep exploratory insights including:

Player rating distributions

Nationality & club analysis

Position-wise comparisons

Age, potential, and market value relationships

Correlation heatmaps

Top players in various attributes

Outlier detection & analysis

Interactive or static visualizations (Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly)

📊 Key Visualizations

Some of the insights visualized include:

Histogram of overall ratings

Scatterplots (Value vs. Rating, Age vs. Potential)

Boxplots for different positions

Heatmap of attribute correlations

Bar charts for top-rated players

Distribution plots for physical attributes

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas (data cleaning & wrangling)

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly (visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn (optional preprocessing tools)
